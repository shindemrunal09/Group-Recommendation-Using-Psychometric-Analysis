# Group-Recommendation-Using-Psychometric-Analysis
We have proposed an ML model which recommends group members to the user based on his/her behavioural patterns. K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical and Model-Based clustering algorithms were used out of which K-Means proved to be the most efficient algorithm  based on their respective silhouette scores.
